	the owl and the pussycat
	by edward lear     

	==                                                    

	the owl and the pussycat went to sea
		in a beautiful pea green boat,
	they took some money, and plenty of honey,
		wrapped up in a five pound note.
	the owl looked up to the stars above,
		and sung to a small guitar,
	'O lovely Pussy! O Pussy my love!
		what a beautiful Pussy you are,
			you are,
			you are!
	what a beautiful pussy you are!


	pussy said to the owl, 'you elegant fowl!
		how charmingly sweet you sing!
	O let us be married! too long we have tarried:
		but what shall we do for a ring?'
	they sailed away, for a year and a day,
		to the land where the bong-tree grows
	and there in a wood a piggy-wig stood
		with a ring at the end of his nose,
		his nose,
		his nose,
	with a ring at the end of his nose.


	'dear pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
		your ring?' said the piggy, 'i will.'
	so they took it away, and were married next day
		by the turkey who lives on the hill
	they dined on mince, and slices of quince
		which they ate with a runcible spoon;
	and hand in hand, on the edge of the sand
		they danced by the light of the moon,
		the moon,
		the moon,
	they danced by the light of the moon.
